# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview + Purpose
In order to prepare Pewlett Hackard for the "silver tsunami," we have determined the number of employees who are retiring (per title) as well as the number of employees who are eligible to participate in the proposed mentorship program. The results of the analysis will help Pewlett Hackard management 

## Results

- Of all the retiring employees, there are no managers that are eligible for the mentorship program. This isn't a major concern because there are only two "manager" titles opening up, making up less than 1% of the retiring employees overall.
- Almost 30% of the employees who are eligible to be mentors have the title "Engineer," but engineers only make up 16% of all the retiring employees.
- Senior Engineers make up 32% of retiring employees, but less than half of them (approx. 15%) are eligible to be mentors.
- The graphs show that the sections for Senior Staff, Staff, Technical Staff, and Assistant Engineers are similarly sized (respectively) across both groups-- those retiring and those who are retiring and eligible to be mentors. 

## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
